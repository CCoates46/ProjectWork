            <p class="text-para">With tropical rainforests, an abundance of wildlife and 
            pristine beaches, it's no wonder that eco-pioneering Costa Rica has been recognised as 
            one of the happiest and most peaceful countries in the world. Locals really do live by 
            the phrase 'Pura Vida' (the good life), which means channelling a super-healthy 
            lifestyle, from eating well to immersing themselves in nature. For visitors looking 
            for adventure, it's a dreamy destination where you can swap technology and social 
            media for hikes through the jungle, white-water rafting on the rivers and kayaking 
            in the year-round warm sea before flopping on sun-drenched sand.</p>
            <p class="text-para">Early-bird surfers are up at dawn to catch the waves. Intrepid
             naturalists lead jungle treks, pointing out sloths and howler monkeys in the trees.
             And a variety of other experts, from yoga masters to botanists, will pass on their 
             knowledge. Plus, there are vast national parks to explore and smile-inducing spas
             where treatments are aimed at soothing minds as much as bodies. Wellness and wellbeing
             is taken to a higher level, making Costa Rica the ideal destination to reboot and fully
             recharge.</p>

             <li class="header-text3">Sri Lanka</li>

             <p class="text-para">Sri Lanka’s star has certainly risen in recent years.  
            This beautiful island is a great choice for a spa retreat or fitness holiday that 
            combines treatments and exercise with the chance to explore too.  There are golden 
            beaches, historical temples, tea plantations and elephants to see in between relaxing.
            Yoga holidays are popular here with outdoor classes to enjoy the views and sunshine. 
            Plus Ayurveda retreats which offer authentic, personalised treatments to restore inner
            balance and wellbeing.  There are luxury spa breaks for couples or solo friendly holistic 
            retreats – there really is something for everyone, no matter what your goal.  
            So head to Sri Lanka and come back feeling nurtured and culturally enriched.</p>
