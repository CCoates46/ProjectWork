      <p class="intro"><span>Great food, slow travel, the soothing waters of the Aegean Sea…</span> Greece is the perfect wellness destination. 
        The benefits of getting away from it all in the pastoral landscapes of southern Europe have been extolled since ancient times. 
        Hesiod believed the natural world was the embodiment of godly being. Homer waxed lyrical about nature in a way that fuses the holy and the mundane.
        And the Greeks must be doing something right when it comes to wellness. On the island of Ikaria[*], an estimated 33% of the population live to be 90 or more!
        There are retreats nestled in olive groves or remote valleys where the only sound is the clanging of goat bells. Others are out and out fitness camps, with morning workout routines and a focus on healthy eating.
      </p>
      <p>Santorini is one of the top destinations in Greece and is located in the southern Aegean Sea. It belongs to Cyclades, the most well-known Greek group of islands with the characteristic whitewashed villages near the blue sea.  As a volcanic island which was separated after volcano eruptions, Santorini has many unique characteristics. The capital of the island, Fira, as well as many villages, are located at the edge of the cliffs offering unique views to the volcano and Aegean Sea. The picturesque small streets in Fira and Oia (pedestrian areas) invite you to get lost in them and discover every little corner of the white painted small houses and alleys, most of which are carved into the cliffs. The atmosphere of the island pulls you like a magnet and makes it hard to let go…</p>
      <p>The beaches of Santorini are unique too, with their black colored sand, their clear waters and their diversity, some suitable for those who want to spend a busy day at the beach and others for those seeking calmness and relaxation.Whether you are looking for places to visit, villages, beaches, what to see and do, how to get and move around, or where to stay in Santorini, we are here to give you insider's information…</p>
