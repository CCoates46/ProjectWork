                <h1>What is Wellness Tourism?</h1>

                <p>Wellness Tourism involves travel with the aim of facilitating well-being
                and good health through psychological, spiritual, or physical activities.</p>
                <p>Welness Tourism differs markedly from medical tourism. The former involves tourism focused 
                on prevention of diseases and maintaining quality of life, whereas the latter generally involves
                travel for the purpose of receiving treatment for a diagnosed disease or medical condition.</p>
                </p>
                <p>The overall wellness market was valued at $4.2 trillion during 2017. It is believed that since 
                then, the number has continued to increase, given that more and more people showcase an active interest
                in their overall health and wellness. This is a very positive trend that is sure to have great and lasting 
                effects in the long run.</p>
                <p>5.3% of global economic output is generated by the health and wellness industry.</p>
                <p>Only 56% of people believe they are in excellent or very good health.</p>
                <p>Wellness tourism is gaining traction, as it stands for 17% of global tourism expenditures. More and more 
                people choose to travel for wellness, given the numerous physical and mental benefits associated with exploring the world.</p>
