            <h2>What is Wellness Tourism?</h2>

            <p>Wellness Tourism involves travel with the aim of facilitating well-being
            and good health through psychological, spiritual, or physical activities.</p>
            <p>Welness Tourism differs markedly from medical tourism. The former involves tourism focused 
            on prevention of diseases and maintaining quality of life, whereas the latter generally involves
            travel for the purpose of receiving treatment for a diagnosed disease or medical condition.</p>
